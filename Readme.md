# **Auto Insurance Data Analysis**

This project delves into the critical aspects of an auto insurance company's operations, focusing on customer lifetime value (CLV), customer churn, and response to new policy advertisements. By employing a comprehensive analytical approach, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), survival analysis, and regression modeling, this study aims to provide valuable insights for enhancing customer retention, optimizing marketing strategies, and improving overall profitability. 

The analysis encompasses several key areas:

* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** An in-depth exploration of CLV drivers to identify high-value customer segments and understand their characteristics.
* **Churn Analysis:** A comprehensive evaluation of customer churn patterns using hazard and survival analysis to pinpoint key factors influencing customer attrition.
* **Response to New Policy Advertisements:** An analysis of factors affecting customer response to new policy advertisements, enabling targeted marketing campaigns.
* **Predictive Modeling:** The development of regression models to predict CLV and classification models to forecast customer response to new policies.

Through these analyses, this project seeks to equip the insurance company with actionable insights to optimize its business strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable growth.
